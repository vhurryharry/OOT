# 10. Use Inky for responsive HTML emails

Date: 2019-11-07

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Creating beautifully designed emails that work on every email client
and every screen size is complex, so an HTML/CSS framework is
necessary for this application.

## Decision

One of the most popular frameworks for HTML email design is called
[Inky][1]. It defines a syntax based on some simple tags which are
later transformed into the real HTML code sent to users.

## Consequences

Better maitainability and more design freedom when communicating
with the customer base.
